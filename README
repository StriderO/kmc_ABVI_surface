This is kinetic Monte Carlo codes of ABVI systems with surfaces (with prefix kmc_)
    1. par.h: input parameters 
    
    2. global.h, global.cpp: contains global constants, variables and global functions
    
    3. initial.h, initial.cpp: initiate the simulation
    
    4. events_*: perform events in the simulation
        a. main.cpp: for each step it is executed once
                     go through all rate calculations, pick one event and perfomr it
        b. ecal.cpp: calculate energy of an input configuration
        c. vrcal.cpp, events_ircal.cpp: calculate Vacancy and Interstitial jumping rates
        d. recb.cpp: perform an recombination event
        e. genr.cpp: perform a generation event
    
    5. main.cpp: where main function is
